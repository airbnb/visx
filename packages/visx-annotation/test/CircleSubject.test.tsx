/**
 * LLM-GENERATED REFACTOR
 *
 * This file was migrated from Enzyme to RTL using generative AI.
 * To make the migration as clean as possible, the LLM was instructed to
 * use testing patterns similar to Enzyme.
 *
 * If you are making changes to this file, please consider refactoring
 * to more idiomatic RTL (and then removing this banner!).

An axis component consists of a line with ticks, tick labels, and an axis label that helps viewers
interpret your graph.

You can use one of the 4 pre-made axes, or you can create your own based on the `<Axis />` element.
Note that the `@visx/react-spring` package exports an `AnimatedAxis` variant with animated ticks.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @visx/axis
```
